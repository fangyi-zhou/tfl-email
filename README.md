# TfL Weekend Travel Email Summariser

## Overview

Transport for London (TfL) sends out a weekend travel advice email with
information for travel disruptions.
Besides planning engineering, TfL also warns about increased traffic or large
crowd due to large events.
We use large language models (LLM) to provide a summary of the weekend travel
email, and publish the summary as a Telegram bot.

## Getting started

You can try the bot out at https://t.me/tfl_travel_information_bot

Send "/info" to retrieve the summary for this weekend (usually available after
Thursday noon).
